"Family Portrait": The Autobiography of James Alfred Morris
==============

My father passed on to me a manuscript of my great-grandfather's autobiography, which was never properly edited and printed. I'm typesetting the manuscript in LaTeX and storing the project here, while editing it collaboratively with family. 

Feel free to read it, and if you're feeling generous, [contact me](mailto:bmmorris@uw.edu) if you note any corrections that can be made.
