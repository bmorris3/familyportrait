Family Portrait: The Memoirs of James Alfred Morris
==============

My father passed on to me a manuscript of my great-grandfather's autobiography, which were never properly edited and printed. The manuscript was written on a typewriter with lots of hand-written annotations in the margins.

I'm typsetting the manuscript in LaTeX and storing the project here, while editing it collaboratively with family. 

Feel free to read it, and if you're feeling generous, contact me if you note any corrections that can be made.
